# Piltover

Developed with Unreal Engine 4.25.0

# Introduction

Playing Legends of Runterra, I fall in love with the background image where Jinx is standing in front of a very nice looking city.  
I didn't know what this city was and started searching the internet and found out that it was Piltover (& Zhaun).  
With this information, I found more and more pictures of this city and thought that there is something like a 3D environment for it, so that it can be used for the Wallpaper Engine, for example.  
It turns out: No ðŸ˜”

To me:
I'm not very experienced in creating 3D environments and in my daily work I'm a frontend developer using Vue and TypeScript.  
So this journey may take a long time and may not lead to a final end result.  
I do it in my free time and for fun.

## Sessions

### 1. Session

I created a basic pivot building to orient myself and get a feel of scaling.  
So I picked the building down there next to the fountain.

I created a simple tower, a box building and a roof. Some windows and lights added.  
I also made a hole in the ground to simulate Zhaun. (I may never add Zhaun fully to this project ðŸ¤£)

### 2. Session

To create other buildings around my pivot building, I added a camera to take the position of the view of the reference image.  
It turned out to be very difficult and I had to learn a few things about perspective. I found that a 60Â° field of view works well.  
I took the reference image and my camera view and tapped between the image and the engine to match the view. I went crazy and used some post-its to get some anchor points.  
Because of the light coming from behind in this scene, I added two lights and a shiny golden material to improve the process.

After finding a good camera angle and position, I started adding the front right buildings and expanded Zhaun's abyss.  
I also used post-its for them, building by building, working my way to the rear right building.

Then I rebuilt the pivot building based on my measurements with improved scaling.

I started baking lights and it already took about 5-10 minutes to bake ðŸ˜®  
I was confused why the light on the ground floor of the tower no longer casts shadows ðŸ¤”

Then I made a real stupid mistake ðŸ˜£ I forgot that I controlled the reference camera and looked at the result with normal engine controls.  
So I lost the angle and position of the view for the reference image... `CTRL + Z` was too late.  
So I had to find the position again, but because of the progress in real time, I just found a rather poor similar position. So I have to fix this next session.  
To avoid this mistake again, I created a backup camera at the exact position of the reference camera with `CTRL + C` `CTRL + V`.

Final result of this session:
